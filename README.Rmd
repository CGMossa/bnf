The goal of `bnf` is to parse grammar specifications in 
[Backusâ€“Naur form (BNF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) 
and generate language from that grammar.

The focus for #OzUnconf19 was to generate valid R code from a very restricted
subset of the R grammar.

This generated code was then used to calculated coordinates to visualise and turn into audio.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/minilexer")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/bnf")
```
## Turning BNF Grammar into Code

1. Need a grammar in BNF form
2. Turn this into an R list that we can compute on
3. Generate language from this grammar
4. Ask R to `eval()` this language


```{r example}
library(bnf)

# BNF grammar for a simple calculator
cat(bnf:::simple_bnf)

# Turn the BNF into tokens (to make it easier to manipulate)
tokens <- bnf::parse_bnf_text_to_tokens(bnf:::simple_bnf)
tokens

# Turn the tokens into an internal nexted list representation that we can 
# compute on.  This is a *deeply* nested list.
spec <- bnf::parse_bnf_tokens_to_spec(tokens)
cat(paste(deparse(spec), collapse="\n"))
```


```{r}
# Create a random bit of language from this grammar
set.seed(2)
lang <- bnf_expression(spec, spec)
lang
eval(parse(text = lang))
```


## Generate Art: Using a grammar to create code which will calculate coordinates which can be plotted

1. More complicated grammar with some trig functions and function nesting
2. Generate some R language
3. Evaluate the language at a number of grid points
4. Plot it!

```{r}
# Generate some R language from this grammar

# plot it
```
