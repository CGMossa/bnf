The goal of `bnf` is to parse grammar specifications in 
[Backusâ€“Naur form (BNF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) 
and generate language from that grammar.

The focus for #OzUnconf19 was to generate valid R code from a very restricted
subset of the R grammar.

This generated code was then used to calculated coordinates to visualise and turn into audio.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/minilexer")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/bnf")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(bnf)
## basic example code
```
